# Computational Cognition

This website is my contribution to science communication, a place to discuss my current research, and my means of organizing my thoughts on the topics I am passionate about: mathematics, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. 

My goal is to make posts that are concise and useful for a wide audience. To this end, each post will provide a brief intro to the topic at a level that anyone can understand, followed by a concise review of the topic at a level that will hopefully be useful to graduate student researchers in the field. I will also include numerous links for further reading.

The website favicon was designed by <a href="https://www.jthanew.com/">Jthanew</a>, and is inspired by and referencing two of my favourite animes.
