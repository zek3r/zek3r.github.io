# Computational Cognition

Welcome to my homepage! This website's purpose is to provide some info about me, links to my current research endeavours, and house my blog.

The objective of the blog is to provide introductions to science and mathematics related topics that are entertaining and illuminating, primarily organized around two themes. The first theme is what I call mathematical neuroscience, and will span a range of fields mostly focusing on applied math, theoretical neuroscience, and statistical machine learning. This is the topic of my academic research. The second topic is the two-way relationship between STEM and broader systemic forces of economic, social, and political nature. While this is not my PhD research, I have spent a non-negligible amount of time exploring this second topic because, as a STEM researcher who wishes their work to have a positive effect on society, it is critical for me to have knowledge here. I will try to alternate between the two themes with a post on one theme following a post on the other.

I intend to write this blog in an accessible and self contained way so that the reader doesn't need any background to understand it; I hope that it will be thought provoking and inspiring for anyone, be they STEM expert or afternoon internet-scroller.

Feel free to reach out via my email with any feedback! Happy reading:)

[comment]: <> This website is my contribution to science communication, a place to discuss my current research, and my means of organizing my thoughts on the topics I am passionate about: mathematics, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. 

[comment]: <> My goal is to make posts that are concise and useful for a wide audience. To this end, each post will provide a brief intro to the topic at a level that anyone can understand, followed by a concise review of the topic at a level that will hopefully be useful to graduate student researchers in the field. I will also include numerous links for further reading.

[comment]: <> I aim to provide material relevant to a wide readership. That in mind, I will write posts in self-contained modules, each module geared towards readers interested in less, or more, mathematical detail. I will write the minimal math sections to be readable by the layperson; I hope the more mathematical sections and the citations I provide will be useful to graduate students and researchers in neural-ai, applied math, and related fields. Ultimately, I intend this to be a choose-your-own adventure where you can pick out what you want to learn. I also aim to make each blog post *short*, only 2-3 pages including figures, so that even if you read the whole thing you can do it over a half cup of coffee.
