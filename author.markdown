# Ezekiel (Zeke) Williams

I’m a PhD candidate in applied mathematics at Université de Montréal and Mila, the Quebec AI Institute. My research spans applied mathematics, neuroscience, and statistical machine learning--in particular, probability theory, dynamical systems, and learning and memory in Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. My current work focuses on temporal credit assignment--learning problems that require memory--and the roles/impacts of stochasticity in RNNs.

Outside of research, I spend a lot of time frolicking outside, making music (usually inside), engaging in activism, and reading/listening to podcasts on economics, philosophy, politics, and the news.

[comment]: <> I’m really passionate about these topics and spend excessive amounts of time studying them! In my spare time I frolic outside, play guitar, and engage in climate justice and degrowth activism.
