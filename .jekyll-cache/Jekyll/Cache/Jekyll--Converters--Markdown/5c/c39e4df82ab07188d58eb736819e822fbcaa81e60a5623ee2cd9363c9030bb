<h1 id="computational-cognition">Computational Cognition</h1>

<p>This website is my contribution to science communication, a place to discuss my current research, and my means of organizing my thoughts on the topics I am passionate about: mathematics, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>I aim to provide material relevant to a wide readership. That in mind, I will write posts in self-contained modules, each module geared towards readers interested in less, or more, mathematical detail. I will write the minimal math sections to be readable by the layperson; I hope the more mathematical sections and the citations I provide will be useful to graduate students and researchers in neural-ai, applied math, and related fields. Ultimately, I intend this to be a choose-your-own adventure where you can pick out what you want to learn. I also aim to make each blog post <em>short</em>, only 2-3 pages including figures, so that even if you read the whole thing you can do it over a half cup of coffee.</p>

<p>The website favicon was designed by <a href="https://www.jthanew.com/">Jthanew</a>, and is inspired by and referencing two of my favourite animes.</p>
