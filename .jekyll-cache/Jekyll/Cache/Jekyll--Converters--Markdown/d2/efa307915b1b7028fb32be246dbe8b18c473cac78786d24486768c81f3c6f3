<p>Welcome to my first blog post! My first few posts will be about the peer-review publications that I have contributed to during my Masters and PhD thus far. Todayâ€™s blog is about my MSc thesis paper: <strong><em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95037-z">Neural Burst Codes Disguised as Rate Codes</a></em></strong>, a title which will hopefully make sense by the end of this post!</p>
